- Get & install the latest graphlcd-base library from
http://projects.vdr-developer.org/projects/graphlcd
you should consider enabling FreeType support by uncommenting
HAVE_FREETYPE2 in Make.config
- In the glcdprocdriver source directory:
    - Run 'make' and 'make install'.
- Run 'ldconfig'.
- proceed with building LCDproc >= 0.5.x with the "glcdlib" driver enabled;


On Gentoo, just use the provided ebuilds from the overlay or mainline portage
if they are already available. It is advisable to enable the USE flag "truetype".
Just emerge lcdproc with the USE flag "graphlcd" enabled, this will enable building
the "glcdlib" driver which then will pull GLCDprocDriver and graphlcd-base as
dependencies first.
