     - Something removed
     + Something added
     * Something changed / fixed

Version 0.1.2 (released 2015-01-03)
 * compensated rendering position of the BigNum semicolon character;
 * updated README.md.

Version 0.1.1 (released 2014-12-31)
 * workaround a potential crash when BigNums with out of range index (valid are
   only 0-10) are drawn, and introduced colon ':' character to BigNums as well.
 * some more debug logging in driver initialization;
 + added GLCDPROC_VER_MAJOR / _MINOR / _MICRO in glcddriver.h as the only place
   where the version is maintained, which can be evaluated both in the code and
   the Makefile.
 * Github no longer supports uploading distribution source archives, therefore
   adapted module name spelling in glcddriver.h which is now "GLCDprocDriver" to
   match the github project, especially because they now offer tagged releases;
   also aligned archive compression to that of tagged releases, tar.gz.
 * adapted signature of glcddriverDrawText to const char *

Version 0.1.0 (released 2012-10-20)
 * this version does no longer build with graphlcd-base <= 0.1.9, but with
   the current "touchcol" branch of graphlcd-base hosted at
   http://projects.vdr-developer.org/projects/graphlcd;
 + adopted "touchcol" patch;
 * some Makefile tuning for generating versioned .so files and symlinks;
 * moved hosting of the project from http://www.muresan.de/graphlcd/lcdproc/
   to GitHub: http://lucianm.github.com/GLCDprocDriver/
 * renamed README to README.md and adapted its contents to also be displayed
   at the "GitHub page" mentioned;
 * updated URLs.

Version 0.0.6: (released 2010-04-16)
 + adopted gcc44 patch from the gentoo maintainers (thanks Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >)
 * minor changes in compiler and linker flags, especially for allowing debugging

Version 0.0.5: (released 2009-05-28)
 * adapted for compilation with more recent glibc (inclusion of stdlib.h);
 * updated INSTALL file;

Version 0.0.4: (released 2007-04-18)
 + small code cleanups;
 + applied Makefile modifications according to http://bugs.gentoo.org/173271
   (thanks to  Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org > and
   Torsten Veller < tove AT gentoo.org > );

Version 0.0.3: (released 2006-10-05)
 + added  $SONAME to the Makefile (thanks to Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >);
 - removed LDCONFIG call (thanks to Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >);
 + added LDCONFIG warning in the Makefile;
 * commented double declaration of CXXFLAGS in Make.config;
 * adapted INSTALL file.

Version 0.0.2: (released 2005-05-23)
 - removed direct Freetype2 dependency, as GLCDprocdriver actually does not use calls directly to
   Freetype2, and the Freetype2-related code from graphlcd-base should properly log an error if
   it is called without having built graphlcd-base with freetype support;
 - removed (commented) some debug syslog output;
 + added syslog error output if initializing of the "bignum" fonts fails;

Version 0.0.1: (released 2005-05-13)
 + Initial release
