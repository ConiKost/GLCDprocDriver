Key:
     - Something removed
     + Something added
     * Something changed / fixed

Version 0.1.0 (released 2012-10-20)
 * this version does no longer build with graphlcd-base <= 0.1.9, but with
   the current "touchcol" branch of graphlcd-base hosted at
   http://projects.vdr-developer.org/projects/graphlcd;
 + adopted "touchcol" patch;
 * some Makefile tuning for generating versioned .so files and symlinks;
 * moved hosting of the project from http://www.muresan.de/graphlcd/lcdproc/
   to GitHub: http://lucianm.github.com/GLCDprocDriver/
 * renamed README to README.md and adapted its contents to also be displayed
   at the "GitHub page" mentioned;
 * updated URLs.

Version 0.0.6: (released 2010-04-16)
 + adopted gcc44 patch from the gentoo maintainers (thanks Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >)
 * minor changes in compiler and linker flags, especially for allowing debugging

Version 0.0.5: (released 2009-05-28)
 * adapted for compilation with more recent glibc (inclusion of stdlib.h);
 * updated INSTALL file;

Version 0.0.4: (released 2007-04-18)
 + small code cleanups;
 + applied Makefile modifications according to http://bugs.gentoo.org/173271
   (thanks to  Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org > and
   Torsten Veller < tove AT gentoo.org > );

Version 0.0.3: (released 2006-10-05)
 + added  $SONAME to the Makefile (thanks to Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >);
 - removed LDCONFIG call (thanks to Robert Buchholz < rbu AT gentoo.org >);
 + added LDCONFIG warning in the Makefile;
 * commented double declaration of CXXFLAGS in Make.config;
 * adapted INSTALL file.

Version 0.0.2: (released 2005-05-23)
 - removed direct Freetype2 dependency, as GLCDprocdriver actually does not use calls directly to
   Freetype2, and the Freetype2-related code from graphlcd-base should properly log an error if
   it is called without having built graphlcd-base with freetype support;
 - removed (commented) some debug syslog output;
 + added syslog error output if initializing of the "bignum" fonts fails;

Version 0.0.1: (released 2005-05-13)
 + Initial release
